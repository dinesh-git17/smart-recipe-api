SMART RECIPE API
================

Overview:
---------
The Smart Recipe API is a RESTful service built with FastAPI that allows users to manage and discover delicious recipes. 
It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes. The API also offers a /help endpoint for a 
getting-started guide and interactive API documentation available at /docs and /redoc.

Additionally, a separate interactive Python client script (use_api.py) is provided to let users create, view, update, 
delete, and list recipes via a colorful, menu-driven console interface using the Rich library.

Features:
---------
- CRUD endpoints for recipes with ingredient management.
- Detailed endpoint documentation with examples (using Pydantic models).
- A friendly /help endpoint for a getting-started guide.
- Interactive API docs automatically generated by FastAPI at /docs (Swagger UI) and /redoc (ReDoc).
- Custom logging with emoji-enhanced output via a custom logger (mylogger.py).
- A visually pleasing HTML welcome page at the root endpoint.
- An interactive, menu-driven client script (use_api.py) that lets users create custom recipes by providing input for each field.
- Automatic schema updates (with a simple migration approach recommended for production use).

Setup:
------
1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
         python3 -m venv env
         source env/bin/activate
   - On Windows:
         python -m venv env
         env\Scripts\activate

2. Install Dependencies:
   Run the following command to install all required packages:
         pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Database Credentials:
   - Create a file named "secret.py" in the project directory with your database settings.
     For example:
         DB_USER = "your_username"
         DB_PASS = "your_password"
         DB_HOST = "localhost"
         DB_PORT = "5432"
         DB_NAME = "recipes_db"
   - Make sure "secret.py" is added to your .gitignore file.

4. Run the API:
   - In development mode, run:
         uvicorn explore_db:app --reload
   - The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Visit /docs and /redoc for interactive API documentation.
   - Visit /help for a getting-started guide.

5. Use the API Client:
   - Run the interactive client script:
         python use_api.py
   - Use the menu to add, view, update, delete, or list recipes.
   - When adding a recipe, you can enter custom values for each field.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
- The API uses SQLite by default for simplicity; you can update the DATABASE_URL in explore_db.py to use another database.
- For schema changes (e.g., adding new columns), you can either use a migration tool like Alembic or implement a simple update_schema function.
- The project is designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate advanced REST API development with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and interactive documentation.
- Enjoy exploring and managing your recipes!
